# organelle-fluorescence-analysis-glm
This RStudio project analyzes normalized GFP intensity across different organelles over time using a **General Linear Model (GLM)**. The analysis includes data summarization, visualization, and statistical modeling to understand fluorescence trends across conidia cell compartments and organelle markers.
